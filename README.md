# JointSavingsAccount

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts for the financial institution, Solidity smart contract has been created that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

Smart contract has been compiled and deployed. Following images is being presennted as an evidence:
